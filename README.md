# OpenHASP-NodeRed-CalDav-Display
Some Example how OpenHASP can display some CalDav-events via MQTT and with the help of NodeRed

The blogpost (in german) https://loest.org/2026/02/04/smartgemeindehaus-v-raumplan-touch-display/

The requirements:
- Display with OpenHASP installed -> pages.jsonl 
- Nodered with node-red-contrib-ical-events -> flows_nodered.json
- MQTT-Server für the communication between the two.
- optional: Motion sensor -> flows_nodered_motionsensor.json

Disclaimer: I am no pro in these things. I bet there are smarter solutions for that, but somebody has asked how my Display works...
